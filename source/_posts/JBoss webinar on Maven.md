There's a bunch of JBoss developers webinars on Vimeo. You can check them out here:

Unfortunately, most of them have horrible, barely audible sound. There's some really interesting stuff there, so it's a shame JBoss couldn't invest in a decent microphone.  

One of the usable ones is the one about setting up a Nexus Maven repository. It starts with a general introduction on repository handling in Maven and then gives some pretty useful tips that they learned in JBoss's recent switch to Nexus.
